## How I worked on this project

Hello Friends .
Well , first i recently learn how Testing React components with Jest ,so i're  i start a new project to learn more from testing.
from TDD i start writing test with fail status and i wrote enough implementation to pass the test and then working on the refactor phase.
perhaps i have made mistake when writing test or testing wrong part of the app but i know  i get better over time .
